# MSU Thesis Class Version 4.1e 2023/07/24

Copyright 2011-2023 by Alan Munn <amunn@msu.edu>

This is a class file for producing dissertations and theses according to
the Michigan State University Graduate School Guidelines for Electronic
Submission of Master's Theses and Dissertations (January 2023).

The class is based on the `memoir` document class, and therefore inherits
all of the functionality of that class.


# Update on new formatting requirements (Fall 2022)

 The `msu-thesis` development team is displeased to announce a new
  and "improved" version of the class that conforms to the most recent
  (September 2022) MSU Thesis Formatting Guide.
  Among the notable new features are implementation of questionable
  formatting requirements that will make your thesis look more and more
  like it was produced using MSWord. Other important changes include
  a new title page with your name 2 inches lower than before, and a
  new copyright page with the copyright text left aligned and centred
  vertically, a tour de force of bad typography.
  Some minor positive changes include the removal of bibliography
  and appendix cover pages.
