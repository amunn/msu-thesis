# MSU Thesis Class Documentation

## UPDATE May 26, 2023

 - Because of conflicting reports of spacing issues with chapter titles, I've reinstituted some spacing after chapter titles that the thesis office wanted removed. This may be problematic since they are so inconsistent with their measuring. If they complain about too *much* space after chapter titles, please let me know, but you can add the following to your preamble to solve the problem:
 
`\setlength{\afterchapskip}{0pt}`


## Getting started

- If you are using an up-to-date TeXLive or MikTeX you may simply need to update your distribution to have the most recent version of the package.

- If you are using a Linux installed distribution of TeXLive or you do not have the current year's TeX Live installed, you may not have the most recent version, so you should install the latest version.

If you do need to install manually, the simplest install simply puts the `msu-thesis.cls` file into the folder that your main thesis `.tex` file is located. Alternatively you can install it into your local `texmf` folder.  See the [README](https://github.com/amunn/msu-thesis) for details.

- If you are using Overleaf, you should upload a copy of `msu-thesis.cls` to your project.

## Download the a basic template file
